    paragraphs: [
      "I’m passionate about technology and fascinated by how data can drive smarter decisions. Over the years, I’ve dedicated my career to exploring how systems, platforms, and modern data architectures can transform raw information into valuable insights.",
      "I focus on applying solid principles of data engineering, integration, data quality, and governance—leveraging tools such as Informatica PowerCenter, IDMC, MDM, and cloud-based architectures—to build reliable, scalable, and high-performance data solutions.",
      "I believe that it’s not only about moving or transforming data, but about doing it with accuracy, quality, and purpose. That’s why I work carefully through each stage of the data lifecycle: ingestion, validation, orchestration, monitoring, and optimization—ensuring that every pipeline supports real business impact.",
      "And while my work is deeply technical, I also understand the importance of clarity. Well-structured data models, intuitive documentation, and meaningful visualizations are essential to help teams understand and trust the information behind every decision.",
      "In short, I’m someone who enjoys solving complex problems, designing efficient data flows, and turning challenges into opportunities through well-crafted engineering."
